# People Detector
This is a simple script that uses OpenCVs HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients).
Instead of using standard Machine-Learning or AI to detect a person HOG converts the images to horizontal and vertical lighting vectors and passes that into it's own clasifiers that's made for detecting people that are standing upright
